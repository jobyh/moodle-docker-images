# Docker Image Scripts

Build scripts for Docker images which can be used in combination
with `docker-compose` to create custom local environments based on
whatever your requirements are.

Please note **the built images will not include Moodle**. The `Dockerfile`s
are my own builds and intended to work in conjunction with a locally checked
out Moodle or Totara Learn repository. Organising here is a WIP so for details
on the volumes you should mount please check out the corresponding `Dockerfile`.
